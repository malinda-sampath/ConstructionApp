### Database Setup and Configuration: MySQL with XAMPP

To successfully run this project with a MySQL database using XAMPP, please follow the steps outlined below:

---

#### **1. Importing the Database**
   
   Ensure that the database is correctly set up by importing the provided `.sql` file. The SQL file is located within the `repository` folder of this solution. Follow these steps:
   
   1. Launch **phpMyAdmin** via XAMPP.
   2. Create a new database (or select an existing one).
   3. Import the SQL file:
      - Go to the **Import** tab.
      - Choose the `.sql` file from the `repository` folder.
      - Click **Go** to execute the import.

#### **2. Exporting the Database after Changes**

   If you make any changes to the database schema or data, be sure to export the updated database and commit the changes to GitHub:
   
   1. In **phpMyAdmin**, select your database.
   2. Navigate to the **Export** tab.
   3. Choose the export method (**Quick** or **Custom**, as needed) and format (**SQL**).
   4. Save the `.sql` file and replace the existing one in the `repository` folder.
   5. Commit and push the updated `.sql` file to your GitHub repository to ensure the latest database schema is tracked.

#### **3. Troubleshooting Database Connection Issues**

   If you encounter any issues connecting to the database, consider the following steps to resolve them:

   - **Ensure the MySQL Dependency is Installed:**
     - Verify that the `MySql.Data` NuGet package is installed in your solution. If not, install it via the **NuGet Package Manager**:
       1. Open Visual Studio.
       2. Go to **Tools** > **NuGet Package Manager** > **Manage NuGet Packages for Solution**.
       3. Search for `MySql.Data` and install the package.
   
   - **Verify the Connection String in App.config:**
     - Double-check that the connection string in the `App.config` file is correctly configured for your environment. Ensure it matches your local MySQL setup
